Once upon a time I had a deep pain. Please never talk about it.


git init 
Starts git

git add . 
adds all files in folder to git

git status
Let's you know the situation with commitment

git commit -m "The commit message is super important!"
Commit files ready for push. Always add message
Commit message should be written in present tense by convention

git log
shows when commits were made
