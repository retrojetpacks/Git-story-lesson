Once upon a time I had a deep pain. Please never talk about it.


git init 
Starts git

git add . 
adds all files in folder to git 'staging area'

git status
Let's you know the situation with commitment

git commit -m "The commit message is super important!"
Commit files ready for push. Always add message
Commit message should be written in present tense by convention

git log
shows when commits were made

git diff chapter1.txt 
Shows where all changes have been made, similar to emacs diff

git remote add origin address
Tell git that you've set up an external place to store stuff
origin is the name, can be anything but origin by convention
address is web address, probably github
